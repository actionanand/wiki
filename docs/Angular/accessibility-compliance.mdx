### **What is Accessibility (a11y)?**
Accessibility refers to designing and developing websites, applications, and tools in a way that they can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. This includes considerations for users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

**a11y** is a numeronym for **"accessibility"**. The number **11** represents the 11 letters between the first letter "a" and the last letter "y" in the word "accessibility."

### **Why is Accessibility Important?**
- Ensures inclusivity for all users.
- Improves usability for everyone, not just users with disabilities.
- Often required by laws and regulations (e.g., WCAG, ADA, Section 508).

### **Key Aspects of Accessibility (a11y):**
1. **Perceivable**: Content must be presented in ways users can perceive (e.g., text alternatives for images).
2. **Operable**: Users must be able to interact with the interface (e.g., keyboard navigation).
3. **Understandable**: Content and interface must be easy to understand.
4. **Robust**: Content must work across various devices, browsers, and assistive technologies.

### **Standards and Guidelines:**
- **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**: A set of guidelines for making web content accessible.
- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: Attributes to enhance accessibility for dynamic content and user interface components.

To implement **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** principles (**POUR**) and **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** in an Angular application, you can follow these best practices:

## **WCAG Principles (POUR)** in Angular

The correct pronunciation of **WCAG** is typically **"W-C-A-G"**, where each letter is pronounced individually: **"double-u see ay gee"**. However, some people pronounce it as **"wi-kag"** or **"double-yu-kag"**, but the most widely accepted pronunciation is spelling out the letters: **"W-C-A-G"**.

### 1. **Perceivable**
   - Ensure that content is presented in ways that users can perceive.

#### Implementation in Angular:
- **Text Alternatives for Images**:
  Use the `alt` attribute for images.
  ```html
  <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
  ```

- **ARIA Roles and Labels**:
  Use ARIA attributes to provide additional context for screen readers.
  ```html
  <button aria-label="Submit Form">Submit</button>
  ```

- **Angular Material Accessibility**:
  Angular Material components are designed with accessibility in mind.
  ```html
  <mat-form-field>
    <mat-label>Username</mat-label>
    <input matInput placeholder="Enter your username">
  </mat-form-field>
  ```

- **Color Contrast**:
  Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors. Use tools like [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify.

---

### 2. **Operable**
   - Ensure that users can interact with the interface using a keyboard or other assistive technologies.

#### Implementation in Angular:
- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and navigable using the `tab` key.
  ```html
  <button tabindex="0">Click Me</button>
  ```

- **Focus Management**:
  Use Angular's `Renderer2` or `@angular/cdk/a11y` to manage focus dynamically.
  ```typescript
  import { FocusMonitor } from '@angular/cdk/a11y';

  constructor(private focusMonitor: FocusMonitor) {}

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    this.focusMonitor.focusVia(this.buttonElement, 'keyboard');
  }
  ```

- **Skip Links**:
  Provide a "Skip to Content" link for keyboard users.
  ```html
  <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to Content</a>
  <div id="main-content">
    <!-- Main content here -->
  </div>
  ```

- **Avoid Time Limits**:
  Avoid or provide options to extend time limits for user interactions.

---

### 3. **Understandable**
   - Ensure that the interface is easy to understand and operate.

#### Implementation in Angular:
- **Form Validation with Clear Error Messages**:
  Use Angular's reactive forms and provide descriptive error messages.
  ```html
  <form [formGroup]="form">
    <input formControlName="email" placeholder="Email">
    <div *ngIf="form.get('email')?.invalid && form.get('email')?.touched">
      <p>Email is required and must be valid.</p>
    </div>
  </form>
  ```

- **Consistent Navigation**:
  Use Angular's `RouterModule` to maintain consistent navigation patterns.
  ```typescript
  const routes: Routes = [
    { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
    { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  ];
  ```

- **Readable Content**:
  Use simple language and avoid jargon. Provide tooltips or help text where necessary.
  ```html
  <button matTooltip="Click to submit the form">Submit</button>
  ```

---

### 4. **Robust**
   - Ensure that the application works well across different browsers, devices, and assistive technologies.

#### Implementation in Angular:
- **Semantic HTML**:
  Use semantic HTML elements to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.
  ```html
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>
  </header>
  ```

- **Responsive Design**:
  Use Angular's `@angular/flex-layout` or CSS media queries to ensure responsiveness.
  ```html
  <div fxLayout="row" fxLayoutAlign="center center">
    <div fxFlex="50%">Content</div>
  </div>
  ```

- **Testing with Assistive Technologies**:
  Test your application with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS) and browser accessibility tools.

- **Use ARIA Attributes**:
  Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies by using ARIA attributes where necessary.
  ```html
  <div role="alert" aria-live="polite">Form submitted successfully!</div>
  ```

---

## **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** in Angular

### Common ARIA Attributes:
1. **`aria-label`**:
   Provides a label for an element.
   ```html
   <button aria-label="Close">X</button>
   ```

2. **`aria-labelledby`**:
   Links an element to another element that provides its label.
   ```html
   <div id="dialog-title">Dialog Title</div>
   <div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title">
     Dialog content here.
   </div>
   ```

3. **`aria-live`**:
   Announces dynamic content changes to screen readers.
   ```html
   <div role="alert" aria-live="polite">Your changes have been saved.</div>
   ```

4. **`role`**:
   Defines the role of an element (e.g., `button`, `alert`, `dialog`).
   ```html
   <div role="dialog">This is a dialog</div>
   ```

5. **`aria-hidden`**:
   Hides elements from assistive technologies.
   ```html
   <div aria-hidden="true">This content is hidden</div>
   ```

---

## Tools for Accessibility in Angular:
1. **Angular CDK Accessibility**:
   Use the `@angular/cdk/a11y` package for managing focus, keyboard shortcuts, and more.
   ```typescript
   import { FocusMonitor } from '@angular/cdk/a11y';
   ```

2. **Linting for Accessibility**:
   Use tools like `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` or `axe` to identify accessibility issues.

3. **Accessibility Testing Tools**:
   - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) (built into Chrome DevTools)
   - [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/)
   - [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) (screen reader)
   - [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)

By following these guidelines and leveraging Angular's built-in tools and libraries, you can ensure your application adheres to WCAG's **POUR** principles and provides an accessible experience for all users.

## **Property Binding**

you were introduced to **Property Binding** - a key Angular feature that allows you to bind element properties to dynamic values.

For example, `<img [src]="someSrc">` binds the `src` property of the underlying [HTMLImageElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement) DOM object to the value stored in `someSrc`.

Whilst it might look like you're binding the src attribute of the `<img>` tag, you're actually NOT doing that. Instead, property binding really targets the underlying DOM object property (in this case a property that's also called `src`) and binds that.

This might look like a subtle detail (and often it indeed doesn't matter) but it's important to understand this difference between element attributes and property. [This article](https://jakearchibald.com/2024/attributes-vs-properties/) can help with understanding this difference.

Whilst it won't make a difference in Angular apps in many cases, it DOES matter if you're trying to set attributes on elements dynamically. Attributes which don't have an equally-named underlying property.

For example, when binding [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), you can't target an underlying DOM object property.

Since "Property Binding" wants to target properties (and not attributes), that can be a problem. That's why Angular offers a slight variation of the "Property Binding" syntax that does allow you to bind attributes to dynamic values.

It looks like this:

```ts
<div 
  role="progressbar" 
  [attr.aria-valuenow]="currentVal" 
  [attr.aria-valuemax]="maxVal">...</div>
```

By adding `attr` in front of the attribute name you want to bind dynamically, you're "telling" Angular that it shouldn't try to find a property with the specified name but instead bind the respective attribute - in the example above, the `aria-valuenow` and `aria-valuemax` attributes would be bound dynamically.
