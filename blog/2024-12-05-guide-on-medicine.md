## <Highlight color='#800031' highlight='fg' fontWeight='bold'>Bacillus Clausii vs Lacticasei bacillus casei</Highlight>

While both <Highlight color='#25c2a0'> Bacillus Clausii </Highlight> and <Highlight color='#25c2a0'> Lacticaseibacillus casei </Highlight> (previously known as <Highlight color='#C0C0C0'> Lactobacillus casei </Highlight>) are considered probiotic bacteria, the key difference lies in their ability to form spores and the conditions they thrive in, with Bacillus Clausii being more **resilient to harsh environments due to its ability to form spores**, while Lacticaseibacillus casei is typically found in environments with lower pH levels and is associated with lactic acid production and Lacticaseibacillus casei **does not form spores as well**; making Bacillus Clausii potentially more suitable for situations where gut conditions are highly acidic, like after antibiotic use, and to treate acute diarrhea, while Lacticaseibacillus casei could be beneficial for general gut health maintenance.
